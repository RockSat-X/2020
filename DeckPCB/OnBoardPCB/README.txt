Things that need to be fixed
-ArduinoMegaDigital2 (U27) pin 4 Timer Events connection needs to be added to the other set of digital pins on the Mega.
	This 36 pin connection will need to be added. Maybe all digital pins used can be changed to using this one 36 pin section?
-Add pins for raspberry pi connections for TTL Serial Camera. You wont need to add all of the raspberry pi pins, just pins 8 and 10.
-The Big Easy Driver pcb through holes have been added, but the board will need to be expanded to fit all of the things
-All footprints for the capacitors, reistors, transistors, etc need to be double checked with the footprints of the parts that are going to be ordered.

Things to note
-Raspberry Pi probably should be on top to allow for ribbon cable connection, then PCB, then arduino mega on bottom?
-SunnyBuddy is huge, and might want to mount it separately to allow for a smaller pcb. Same with some of the other ones.
